## Optimal control of trajectory of a reusable launcher in OpenMDAO/dymos

# Source code

This directory contains the source code written for our research project

## Installation

* download the src folder
* do not modify the directory structure to maintain consistency with the defined relative paths
* run one of the scripts in the *Mains* subdirectory as described under **Run a simulation**

## Run a simulation

There are to ways for running a simulation and dispaly the results:

* perform a new optimiation to obtain your own solution starting from custom values for the different parameters for which multiple examples are already included in the scripts

* load a structure stored in one of the three *data* directories that contains the results already obtained for an optimal transfer trajectory

In either case do the following:

* open one of the scripts in the *Mains* subdirectory
* read the list that describes the different possibilities and choose the appropriate value for the variable *ch*
* optionally define your own parameters to perform a new optimization
* run the script and wait for the results to be displayed
