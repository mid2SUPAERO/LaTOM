# TODO List

## Results

* Implement continuation for LLO to HEO transfers
* Recompute MetaModel for LLO to HEO transfers with thrust/weight ratio down to 0
* Fix MetaModel for ascent and descent trajectories with vertical take-off and landing
* Complete three-dimensional transfers
* thrust/weight ratio in logarithmic scale for continuation: `np.arange(1.9, -3.1, -0.1)`

## Documentation

* Complete docstrings for each module
* Update README.md
* Modify first line of comments in each module to be displayed by autosummary
* Include scripts
* Modify rendering of inheritance diagrams
* Include logo (ask Laurent his rendering of the launcher)
* Think of an acronym for the package name
